            Hello! This mini-site is dedicated to showing off the exercises and projects I have done using Javascript
            and JQuery. The menu above contains everything. Here is the breakdown of what the objective
            for each item is:
        <ul class="ul-space">
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 1: Creating this web page was the first objective. It needs to be the
                "homebase" that links to all the content that follows. Another part was to incorporate a file called
                "exercise1.js" to create an alert to pop-up
                upon entering this page. Remember when you got a pop-up that said 'Welcome to My World!'? That was it.
            </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 2: Prompt the user to enter their favorite number and website. The number that
                was entered is used to generate a random quote of the day that is then displayed. The website that was
                entered will then be listed at the end of a list of three of my favorite websites.</li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 3: Quiz of 3 questions that you have 3 chances to answer each correctly before
                continuing on to the next question. It reveals the answers at the end and grades you.</li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 4: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 5: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 6: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 7: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 8: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 9: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 10: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Exercise 11: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Project 1: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Project 2: </li>
            <li class="li-space">Project 3: </li>
        </ul>
